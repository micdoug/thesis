ABSTRACT="In the era of mobile computing, understanding human mobility patterns is
crucial in order to better design protocols and applications. Many works
focus on different aspects of human mobility such as people's points of
interests, routes, traffic, individual mobility patterns, among others. In
this work we propose to look at human mobility through a social
perspective, i.e., analyse the impact of social groups in mobility
patterns. We use MIT Reality Mining proximity trace to detect, track and
investigate group's evolution throughout time. Our results show that group
meetings happen in a periodical fashion, presenting daily and weekly
periodicity. We analyse how groups' dynamics change over day hours and find
that group meetings that last longer are those with less changes in members
composition and those with members which have stronger social bonds with
each other. Our findings can be used to propose meeting prediction
algorithms, opportunistic routing and information diffusion protocols that
take advantage of those revealed properties."
